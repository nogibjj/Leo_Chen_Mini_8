## Purpose
The goal of this project is to build an ETL-Query pipeline. I used one of FiveThirtyEight's public datasets, extracted it into a local CSV file, loaded it into a .db file, and queried it. Both `Python` and `Rust` were used in the query phase (doing the same tasks) to show the improvements in speed and resource usage provided by `Rust`.

## Data Source
U.S. births data for the years 2000 to 2014, as provided by the Social Security Administration

Header | Definition
---|---------
`year` | Year
`month` | Month
`date_of_month` | Day number of the month
`day_of_week` | Day of week, where 1 is Monday and 7 is Sunday
`births` | Number of births

## CRUD Operations
Operations can be found [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/Leo_Chen_Mini_8/blob/main/mylib/query.py)
1. Create: `create a new record: 2024, 10, 5, 6, 7785`
2. Read: `read all data`
3. Update: `update record 55: births = 7899`
4. Delete: `delete record 420`

## Performance Comparison Report
A performance comparison report has been produced to show the improvements in speed and resource usage provided by `Rust`. Access the report [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/Leo_Chen_Mini_8/blob/main/report.md).
